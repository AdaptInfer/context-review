    "abstract": "The linear varying coefficient models posits a linear relationship between an outcome and covariates in which the covariate effects are modeled as functions of additional effect modifiers. Despite a long history of study and use in statistics and econometrics, state-of-the-art varying coefficient modeling methods cannot accommodate multivariate effect modifiers without imposing restrictive functional form assumptions or involving computationally intensive hyperparameter tuning. In response, we introduce VCBART, which flexibly estimates the covariate effect in a varying coefficient model using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With simple default settings, VCBART outperforms existing varying coefficient methods in terms of covariate effect estimation, uncertainty quantification, and outcome prediction. We illustrate the utility of VCBART with two case studies: one examining how the association between later-life cognition and measures of socioeconomic position vary with respect to age and socio-demographics and another estimating how temporal trends in urban crime vary at the neighborhood level. An R package implementing VCBART is available at https://github.com/skdeshpande91/VCBART",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful black-box predictors that have achieved impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks. However, their accuracy comes at the cost of intelligibility: it is usually unclear how they make their decisions. This hinders their applicability to high stakes decision-making domains such as healthcare. We propose Neural Additive Models (NAMs) which combine some of the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent intelligibility of generalized additive models. NAMs learn a linear combination of neural networks that each attend to a single input feature. These networks are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily complex relationships between their input feature and the output. Our experiments on regression and classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees. They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models in accuracy, but are more flexible because they are based on neural nets instead of boosted trees. To demonstrate this, we show how NAMs can be used for multitask learning on synthetic data and on the COMPAS recidivism data due to their composability, and demonstrate that the differentiability of NAMs allows them to train more complex interpretable models for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we estimate the dynamic parameters of a time-varying coefficient model through radial kernel functions in the context of a longitudinal study. Our proposal is based on a linear combination of weighted kernel functions involving a bandwidth, centered around a given set of time points. In addition, we study different alternatives of estimation and inference including a Frequentist approach using weighted least squares along with bootstrap methods, and a Bayesian approach through both Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational methods. We compare the estimation strategies mention above with each other, and our radial kernel functions proposal with an expansion based on regression spline, by means of an extensive simulation study considering multiples scenarios in terms of sample size, number of repeated measurements, and subject-specific correlation. Our experiments show that the capabilities of our proposal based on radial kernel functions are indeed comparable with or even better than those obtained from regression splines. We illustrate our methodology by analyzing data from two AIDS clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Context-specific Bayesian networks (i.e. directed acyclic graphs, DAGs) identify context-dependent relationships between variables, but the non-convexity induced by the acyclicity requirement makes it difficult to share information between context-specific estimators (e.g. with graph generator functions). For this reason, existing methods for inferring context-specific Bayesian networks have favored breaking datasets into subsamples, limiting statistical power and resolution, and preventing the use of multidimensional and latent contexts. To overcome this challenge, we propose NOTEARS-optimized Mixtures of Archetypal DAGs (NOTMAD). NOTMAD models context-specific Bayesian networks as the output of a function which learns to mix archetypal networks according to sample context. The archetypal networks are estimated jointly with the context-specific networks and do not require any prior knowledge. We encode the acyclicity constraint as a smooth regularization loss which is back-propagated to the mixing function; in this way, NOTMAD shares information between context-specific acyclic graphs, enabling the estimation of Bayesian network structures and parameters at even single-sample resolution. We demonstrate the utility of NOTMAD and sample-specific network inference through analysis and experiments, including patient-specific gene expression networks which correspond to morphological variation in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies of associations between environmental exposures and health outcomes have shifted toward estimating the effect of simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals. Summary index methods, such as the weighted quantile sum and quantile g-computation, are now commonly used to analyze environmental exposure mixtures in a broad range of applications. These methods provide a simple and interpretable framework for quantifying mixture effects. However, when data arise from a large geographical study region, it may be unreasonable to expect a common mixture effect. In this work, we explore the use of a recently developed spatially varying coefficient model based on Bayesian additive regression trees to estimate spatially heterogeneous mixture effects using quantile g-computation. We conducted simulation studies to evaluate the method's performance. We then applied this model to an analysis of multiple ambient air pollutants and birthweight in Georgia, USA from 2005-2016. We find evidence of county-level spatially varying mixture associations, where for 17 of 159 counties in Georgia, elevated concentrations of a mixture of PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide were associated with a reduction in birthweight by as much as -16.65 grams (95% credible interval: -33.93, -0.40) per decile increase in all five air pollutants.",

(On cyclic gradient boosting machines, 2023). Modelling the coefficient functions using a CGBM allows for dimension-wise early stopping and feature importance scores. The dimension-wise early stopping not only reduces the risk of dimension-specific overfitting, but also reveals differences in model complexity across dimensions. The use of feature importance scores allows for simple feature selection and easy model interpretation. The model is evaluated on the same simulated and real data examples as those used in Richman and Wüthrich (Scand Actuar J 2023:71–95, 2023), and the results show that it produces results in terms of out of sample loss that are comparable to those of their neural network-based VCM called LocalGLMnet.</jats:p>",

We apply this approach to lung cancer by training a deep neural network to predict discriminative subtypes from histopathology images, and use these predicted subtypes to generate models which classify adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and healthy tissue based on transcriptomic signatures. In this way, we optimize the latent discriminative subtypes through induced prediction loss, and the discriminative subtypes are interpreted with standard interpretation of transcriptomic predictive models. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy (F1-score of 0.97) and identifies discriminative subtypes which link histopathology images to transcriptomic explanations without requiring pre-specification of morphological patterns or transcriptomic processes.</jats:p>",

Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from expression data can help characterize this regulation-driven heterogeneity, but network inference requires many statistical samples, limiting GRNs to cluster-level analyses that ignore intra-cluster heterogeneity. We propose to move beyond coarse analyses of pre-defined subgroups by using<jats:italic>contextualized</jats:italic>learning, a multi-task learning paradigm that uses multi-view contexts including phenotypic, molecular, and environmental information to infer personalized models. With sample-specific contexts, contextualization enables sample-specific models and even generalizes at test time to predict network models for entirely unseen contexts. We unify three network model classes (Correlation, Markov, Neighborhood Selection) and estimate context-specific GRNs for 7997 tumors across 25 tumor types, using copy number and driver mutation profiles, tumor microenvironment, and patient demographics as model context. Our generative modeling approach allows us to predict GRNs for unseen tumor types based on a pan-cancer model of how somatic mutations affect gene regulation. Finally, contextualized networks enable GRN-based precision oncology by providing a structured view of expression dynamics at sample-specific resolution, explaining known biomarkers in terms of network-mediated effects and leading to novel subtypings that improve survival prognosis.

We introduce contextualized network inference, leveraging multi-view contextual metadata to capture similarities and differences among heterogeneous observations during network estimation. Sharing information across contexts enables inference at sample-specific resolution, thus quantifying variation between subjects and revealing context-specific network rewiring. Applied to tumor-specific transcriptional network inference using clinical, molecular, and multi-omic data, contextualized networks improve accuracy, generalize to unseen cancer types, and discover novel prognostic tumor subtypes. By tailoring disease models to each sample, contextualized networks promise to enable precision medicine at unprecedented resolution.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

However, these models often struggle with balancing the computational efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of the coefficients. This study develops a fast and flexible STVC model to address this challenge. To enhance flexibility and interpretability, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio‐temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. We combine a pre‐conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling, to estimate the strength of each process in each coefficient in a computationally efficient manner, while removing redundant processes as necessary. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. We then apply the proposed method to a crime analysis. The result confirms that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates. The STVC model is implemented in the R package spmoran.</jats:p>",

A three-step variable selection method for single-index varying-coefficients models was proposed in recent research. This method selects varying and constant-effect genetic predictors, as well as non-zero loading parameters, to identify genetic factors that interact linearly or nonlinearly with a mixture of environmental factors to influence disease risk. In this paper, we extend this approach to a binary response setting given that many complex human diseases are binary traits. We also establish the oracle property for our variable selection method, demonstrating that it performs as well as if the correct sub-model were known in advance. Additionally, we assess the performance of our method through finite-sample simulations with both continuous and discrete gene variables. Finally, we apply our approach to a type 2 diabetes dataset, identifying potential genetic factors that interact with a combination of environmental variables, both linearly and nonlinearly, to influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</jats:p>",

Hence, one would expect high acceptance of the VCM as a tool for studying statistical interactions in datasets. Yet, the current paper shows that the VCM is still struggling to migrate from journals in which methods are presented to journals in which methods are utilized. First, a search in Google Scholar with the phrase “varying coefficients” returned ~79,200 results in comparison to returning ~2,710,000 results with the phrase “interaction term”. Second, a bibliometric analysis of publications with the VCM showed that in many research domains, there were more publications with the VCM in journals on methods than publications with the VCM in journals for empirical investigations. Economics and environmental studies stood out with many more publications with the VCM in empirical journals than in journals on statistical methods. The gap between the high acclaims of the VCM in the statistical literature and its low utilization rate in practice should be of concern to the research community. The possible reasons for this gap and its potential remedies are discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Modern learning algorithms excel at producing accurate but complex models of the data. However, deploying such models in the real-world requires extra care: we must ensure their reliability, robustness, and absence of undesired biases. This motivates the development of models that are equally accurate but can be also easily inspected and assessed beyond their predictive performance. To this end, we introduce contextual explanation networks (CEN)---a class of architectures that learn to predict by generating and utilizing intermediate, simplified probabilistic models. Specifically, CENs generate parameters for intermediate graphical models which are further used for prediction and play the role of explanations. Contrary to the existing post-hoc model-explanation tools, CENs learn to predict and to explain simultaneously. Our approach offers two major advantages: (i) for each prediction valid, instance-specific explanation is generated with no computational overhead and (ii) prediction via explanation acts as a regularizer and boosts performance in data-scarce settings. We analyze the proposed framework theoretically and experimentally. Our results on image and text classification and survival analysis tasks demonstrate that CENs are not only competitive with the state-of-the-art methods but also offer additional insights behind each prediction, that can be valuable for decision support. We also show that while post-hoc methods may produce misleading explanations in certain cases, CENs are consistent and allow to detect such cases systematically.",

    "abstract": "Modern applications of machine learning (ML) deal with increasingly heterogeneous datasets comprised of data collected from overlapping latent subpopulations. As a result, traditional models trained over large datasets may fail to recognize highly predictive localized effects in favour of weakly predictive global patterns. This is a problem because localized effects are critical to developing individualized policies and treatment plans in applications ranging from precision medicine to advertising. To address this challenge, we propose to estimate sample-specific models that tailor inference and prediction at the individual level. In contrast to classical ML models that estimate a single, complex model (or only a few complex models), our approach produces a model personalized to each sample. These sample-specific models can be studied to understand subgroup dynamics that go beyond coarse-grained class labels. Crucially, our approach does not assume that relationships between samples (e.g. a similarity network) are known a priori. Instead, we use unmodeled covariates to learn a latent distance metric over the samples. We apply this approach to financial, biomedical, and electoral data as well as simulated data and show that sample-specific models provide fine-grained interpretations of complicated phenomena without sacrificing predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Context-specific Bayesian networks (i.e. directed acyclic graphs, DAGs) identify context-dependent relationships between variables, but the non-convexity induced by the acyclicity requirement makes it difficult to share information between context-specific estimators (e.g. with graph generator functions). For this reason, existing methods for inferring context-specific Bayesian networks have favored breaking datasets into subsamples, limiting statistical power and resolution, and preventing the use of multidimensional and latent contexts. To overcome this challenge, we propose NOTEARS-optimized Mixtures of Archetypal DAGs (NOTMAD). NOTMAD models context-specific Bayesian networks as the output of a function which learns to mix archetypal networks according to sample context. The archetypal networks are estimated jointly with the context-specific networks and do not require any prior knowledge. We encode the acyclicity constraint as a smooth regularization loss which is back-propagated to the mixing function; in this way, NOTMAD shares information between context-specific acyclic graphs, enabling the estimation of Bayesian network structures and parameters at even single-sample resolution. We demonstrate the utility of NOTMAD and sample-specific network inference through analysis and experiments, including patient-specific gene expression networks which correspond to morphological variation in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are often personalized with categorical attributes that are protected, sensitive, self-reported, or costly to acquire. In this work, we show models that are personalized with group attributes can reduce performance at a group level. We propose formal conditions to ensure the \"fair use\" of group attributes in prediction tasks by training one additional model -- i.e., collective preference guarantees to ensure that each group who provides personal data will receive a tailored gain in performance in return. We present sufficient conditions to ensure fair use in empirical risk minimization and characterize failure modes that lead to fair use violations due to standard practices in model development and deployment. We present a comprehensive empirical study of fair use in clinical prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate the prevalence of fair use violations in practice and illustrate simple interventions to mitigate their harm.",

    "abstract": "Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision policies from observed actions; however, existing models force a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability, limiting data-driven interpretations of human decision-making processes. Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically under different contexts. Thus, we develop Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task learning problem, where each context poses a unique task and complex decision policies can be constructed piece-wise from many simple context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear map, and generates new policy models $\\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. We provide two flavors of the CPR framework: one focusing on exact local interpretability, and one retaining full global interpretability. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients ($+7.7\\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box methods, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis of context-specific decision models.",

Contextualized ML estimates heterogeneous functions by applying deep learning to the meta-relationship between contextual information and context-specific parametric models.

    "abstract": "Feature selection is a crucial tool in machine learning and is widely applied across various scientific disciplines. Traditional supervised methods generally identify a universal set of informative features for the entire population. However, feature relevance often varies with context, while the context itself may not directly affect the outcome variable. Here, we propose a novel architecture for contextual feature selection where the subset of selected features is conditioned on the value of context variables. Our new approach, Conditional Stochastic Gates (c-STG), models the importance of features using conditional Bernoulli variables whose parameters are predicted based on contextual variables. We introduce a hypernetwork that maps context variables to feature selection parameters to learn the context-dependent gates along with a prediction model. We further present a theoretical analysis of our model, indicating that it can improve performance and flexibility over population-level methods in complex feature selection settings. Finally, we conduct an extensive benchmark using simulated and real-world datasets across multiple domains demonstrating that c-STG can lead to improved feature selection capabilities while enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability.",

Existing studies often overlook the dynamic effects of these factors in OD regression. Furthermore, with the increasing ease of collecting OD data, the scale of current OD regression data is typically large, necessitating the development of methods for efficiently fitting large-scale migration data. We address the challenge by proposing a new Bayesian interpretation for the proposed OD models, leveraging sufficient statistics for efficient big data computation.
