    "abstract": "We study the adaptive minimax estimation of non-linear integral functionals of a density and extend the results obtained for linear and quadratic functionals to general functionals. The typical rate optimal non-adaptive minimax estimators of \"smooth\" non-linear functionals are higher order U-statistics. Since Lepski's method requires tight control of tails of such estimators, we bypass such calculations by a modification of Lepski's method which is applicable in such situations. As a necessary ingredient, we also provide a method to control higher order moments of minimax estimator of cubic integral functionals. Following a standard constrained risk inequality method, we also show the optimality of our adaptation rates.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples---inputs that are almost indistinguishable from natural data and yet classified incorrectly by the network. In fact, some of the latest findings suggest that the existence of adversarial attacks may be an inherent weakness of deep learning models. To address this problem, we study the adversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust optimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much of the prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a concrete security guarantee that would protect against any adversary. These methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest the notion of security against a first-order adversary as a natural and broad security guarantee. We believe that robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an important stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MadryLab/mnist_challenge and https://github.com/MadryLab/cifar10_challenge.",

    "abstract": "When training a deep neural network for image classification, one can broadly distinguish between two types of latent features of images that will drive the classification. We can divide latent features into (i) \"core\" or \"conditionally invariant\" features $X^\\text{core}$ whose distribution $X^\\text{core}\\vert Y$, conditional on the class $Y$, does not change substantially across domains and (ii) \"style\" features $X^{\\text{style}}$ whose distribution $X^{\\text{style}} \\vert Y$ can change substantially across domains. Examples for style features include position, rotation, image quality or brightness but also more complex ones like hair color, image quality or posture for images of persons. Our goal is to minimize a loss that is robust under changes in the distribution of these style features. In contrast to previous work, we assume that the domain itself is not observed and hence a latent variable.\n  We do assume that we can sometimes observe a typically discrete identifier or \"$\\mathrm{ID}$ variable\". In some applications we know, for example, that two images show the same person, and $\\mathrm{ID}$ then refers to the identity of the person. The proposed method requires only a small fraction of images to have $\\mathrm{ID}$ information. We group observations if they share the same class and identifier $(Y,\\mathrm{ID})=(y,\\mathrm{id})$ and penalize the conditional variance of the prediction or the loss if we condition on $(Y,\\mathrm{ID})$. Using a causal framework, this conditional variance regularization (CoRe) is shown to protect asymptotically against shifts in the distribution of the style variables. Empirically, we show that the CoRe penalty improves predictive accuracy substantially in settings where domain changes occur in terms of image quality, brightness and color while we also look at more complex changes such as changes in movement and posture.",

Specifically, training robust models may not only be more resource-consuming, but also lead to a reduction of standard accuracy. We demonstrate that this trade-off between the standard accuracy of a model and its robustness to adversarial perturbations provably exists in a fairly simple and natural setting. These findings also corroborate a similar phenomenon observed empirically in more complex settings. Further, we argue that this phenomenon is a consequence of robust classifiers learning fundamentally different feature representations than standard classifiers. These differences, in particular, seem to result in unexpected benefits: the representations learned by robust models tend to align better with salient data characteristics and human perception.",

    "abstract": "Overparameterized neural networks can be highly accurate on average on an i.i.d. test set yet consistently fail on atypical groups of the data (e.g., by learning spurious correlations that hold on average but not in such groups). Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) allows us to learn models that instead minimize the worst-case training loss over a set of pre-defined groups. However, we find that naively applying group DRO to overparameterized neural networks fails: these models can perfectly fit the training data, and any model with vanishing average training loss also already has vanishing worst-case training loss. Instead, the poor worst-case performance arises from poor generalization on some groups. By coupling group DRO models with increased regularization---a stronger-than-typical L2 penalty or early stopping---we achieve substantially higher worst-group accuracies, with 10-40 percentage point improvements on a natural language inference task and two image tasks, while maintaining high average accuracies. Our results suggest that regularization is important for worst-group generalization in the overparameterized regime, even if it is not needed for average generalization. Finally, we introduce a stochastic optimization algorithm, with convergence guarantees, to efficiently train group DRO models.",

    "abstract": "Paired estimation of change in parameters of interest over a population plays a central role in several application domains including those in the social sciences, epidemiology, medicine and biology. In these domains, the size of the population under study is often very large, however, the number of observations available per individual in the population is very small (\\emph{sparse observations}) which makes the problem challenging. Consider the setting with $N$ independent individuals, each with unknown parameters $(p_i, q_i)$ drawn from some unknown distribution on $[0, 1]^2$. We observe $X_i \\sim \\text{Bin}(t, p_i)$ before an event and $Y_i \\sim \\text{Bin}(t, q_i)$ after the event. Provided these paired observations, $\\{(X_i, Y_i) \\}_{i=1}^N$, our goal is to accurately estimate the \\emph{distribution of the change in parameters}, $Î´_i := q_i - p_i$, over the population and properties of interest like the \\emph{$\\ell_1$-magnitude of the change} with sparse observations ($t\\ll N$). We provide \\emph{information theoretic lower bounds} on the error in estimating the distribution of change and the $\\ell_1$-magnitude of change. Furthermore, we show that the following two step procedure achieves the optimal error bounds: first, estimate the full joint distribution of the paired parameters using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and then estimate the distribution of change and the $\\ell_1$-magnitude of change using the joint MLE. Notably, and perhaps surprisingly, these error bounds are of the same order as the minimax optimal error bounds for learning the \\emph{full} joint distribution itself (in Wasserstein-1 distance); in other words, estimating the magnitude of the change of parameters over the population is, in a minimax sense, as difficult as estimating the full joint distribution itself.",

Specifically, we analyze the situation in which a learning system obtains datasets from multiple sources, some of which might be biased or even adversarially perturbed. It is known that in the single-source case, an adversary with the power to corrupt a fixed fraction of the training data can prevent PAC-learnability, that is, even in the limit of infinitely much training data, no learning system can approach the optimal test error. In this work we show that, surprisingly, the same is not true in the multi-source setting, where the adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a fixed fraction of the data sources. Our main results are a generalization bound that provides finite-sample guarantees for this learning setting, as well as corresponding lower bounds. Besides establishing PAC-learnability our results also show that in a cooperative learning setting sharing data with other parties has provable benefits, even if some participants are malicious.",

To tackle this problem, we assume that variation across training domains is representative of the variation we might encounter at test time, but also that shifts at test time may be more extreme in magnitude. In particular, we show that reducing differences in risk across training domains can reduce a model's sensitivity to a wide range of extreme distributional shifts, including the challenging setting where the input contains both causal and anti-causal elements. We motivate this approach, Risk Extrapolation (REx), as a form of robust optimization over a perturbation set of extrapolated domains (MM-REx), and propose a penalty on the variance of training risks (V-REx) as a simpler variant. We prove that variants of REx can recover the causal mechanisms of the targets, while also providing some robustness to changes in the input distribution (\"covariate shift\"). By appropriately trading-off robustness to causally induced distributional shifts and covariate shift, REx is able to outperform alternative methods such as Invariant Risk Minimization in situations where these types of shift co-occur.",

Despite a long history of study and use in statistics and econometrics, state-of-the-art varying coefficient modeling methods cannot accommodate multivariate effect modifiers without imposing restrictive functional form assumptions or involving computationally intensive hyperparameter tuning. In response, we introduce VCBART, which flexibly estimates the covariate effect in a varying coefficient model using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With simple default settings, VCBART outperforms existing varying coefficient methods in terms of covariate effect estimation, uncertainty quantification, and outcome prediction.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful black-box predictors that have achieved impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks. However, their accuracy comes at the cost of intelligibility: it is usually unclear how they make their decisions. This hinders their applicability to high stakes decision-making domains such as healthcare. We propose Neural Additive Models (NAMs) which combine some of the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent intelligibility of generalized additive models. NAMs learn a linear combination of neural networks that each attend to a single input feature. These networks are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily complex relationships between their input feature and the output. Our experiments on regression and classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees. They perform similarly to existing state-of-the-art generalized additive models in accuracy, but are more flexible because they are based on neural nets instead of boosted trees. To demonstrate this, we show how NAMs can be used for multitask learning on synthetic data and on the COMPAS recidivism data due to their composability, and demonstrate that the differentiability of NAMs allows them to train more complex interpretable models for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Invariant Causal Prediction (Peters et al., 2016) is a technique for out-of-distribution generalization which assumes that some aspects of the data distribution vary across the training set but that the underlying causal mechanisms remain constant. Recently, Arjovsky et al. (2019) proposed Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), an objective based on this idea for learning deep, invariant features of data which are a complex function of latent variables; many alternatives have subsequently been suggested. However, formal guarantees for all of these works are severely lacking. In this paper, we present the first analysis of classification under the IRM objective--as well as these recently proposed alternatives--under a fairly natural and general model. In the linear case, we show simple conditions under which the optimal solution succeeds or, more often, fails to recover the optimal invariant predictor. We furthermore present the very first results in the non-linear regime: we demonstrate that IRM can fail catastrophically unless the test data are sufficiently similar to the training distribution--this is precisely the issue that it was intended to solve. Thus, in this setting we find that IRM and its alternatives fundamentally do not improve over standard Empirical Risk Minimization.",

A promising formulation is domain-invariant learning, which identifies the key issue of learning which features are domain-specific versus domain-invariant. An important assumption in this area is that the training examples are partitioned into \"domains\" or \"environments\". Our focus is on the more common setting where such partitions are not provided. We propose EIIL, a general framework for domain-invariant learning that incorporates Environment Inference to directly infer partitions that are maximally informative for downstream Invariant Learning. We show that EIIL outperforms invariant learning methods on the CMNIST benchmark without using environment labels, and significantly outperforms ERM on worst-group performance in the Waterbirds and CivilComments datasets. Finally, we establish connections between EIIL and algorithmic fairness, which enables EIIL to improve accuracy and calibration in a fair prediction problem.",

In addition, we study different alternatives of estimation and inference including a Frequentist approach using weighted least squares along with bootstrap methods, and a Bayesian approach through both Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational methods. We compare the estimation strategies mention above with each other, and our radial kernel functions proposal with an expansion based on regression spline, by means of an extensive simulation study considering multiples scenarios in terms of sample size, number of repeated measurements, and subject-specific correlation.

For example, in intrusion detection, existing work seeks to detect either anomalous edges or anomalous subgraphs, but not both. In this paper, we first extend the count-min sketch data structure to a higher-order sketch. This higher-order sketch has the useful property of preserving the dense subgraph structure (dense subgraphs in the input turn into dense submatrices in the data structure). We then propose 4 online algorithms that utilize this enhanced data structure, which (a) detect both edge and graph anomalies; (b) process each edge and graph in constant memory and constant update time per newly arriving edge, and; (c) outperform state-of-the-art baselines on 4 real-world datasets. Our method is the first streaming approach that incorporates dense subgraph search to detect graph anomalies in constant memory and time.",

    "abstract": "The goal of multi-task learning is to enable more efficient learning than single task learning by sharing model structures for a diverse set of tasks. A standard multi-task learning objective is to minimize the average loss across all tasks. While straightforward, using this objective often results in much worse final performance for each task than learning them independently. A major challenge in optimizing a multi-task model is the conflicting gradients, where gradients of different task objectives are not well aligned so that following the average gradient direction can be detrimental to specific tasks' performance. Previous work has proposed several heuristics to manipulate the task gradients for mitigating this problem. But most of them lack convergence guarantee and/or could converge to any Pareto-stationary point. In this paper, we introduce Conflict-Averse Gradient descent (CAGrad) which minimizes the average loss function, while leveraging the worst local improvement of individual tasks to regularize the algorithm trajectory. CAGrad balances the objectives automatically and still provably converges to a minimum over the average loss. It includes the regular gradient descent (GD) and the multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) in the multi-objective optimization (MOO) literature as special cases. On a series of challenging multi-task supervised learning and reinforcement learning tasks, CAGrad achieves improved performance over prior state-of-the-art multi-objective gradient manipulation methods.",

For this reason, existing methods for inferring context-specific Bayesian networks have favored breaking datasets into subsamples, limiting statistical power and resolution, and preventing the use of multidimensional and latent contexts. To overcome this challenge, we propose NOTEARS-optimized Mixtures of Archetypal DAGs (NOTMAD). NOTMAD models context-specific Bayesian networks as the output of a function which learns to mix archetypal networks according to sample context. The archetypal networks are estimated jointly with the context-specific networks and do not require any prior knowledge. We encode the acyclicity constraint as a smooth regularization loss which is back-propagated to the mixing function; in this way, NOTMAD shares information between context-specific acyclic graphs, enabling the estimation of Bayesian network structures and parameters at even single-sample resolution. We demonstrate the utility of NOTMAD and sample-specific network inference through analysis and experiments, including patient-specific gene expression networks which correspond to morphological variation in cancer.",

One of the primary reasons for the adaptability of LLMs in such diverse tasks is their in-context learning (ICL) capability, which allows them to perform well on new tasks by simply using a few task samples in the prompt. Despite their effectiveness in enhancing the performance of LLMs on diverse language and tabular tasks, these methods have not been thoroughly explored for their potential to generate post hoc explanations. In this work, we carry out one of the first explorations to analyze the effectiveness of LLMs in explaining other complex predictive models using ICL. To this end, we propose a novel framework, In-Context Explainers, comprising of three novel approaches that exploit the ICL capabilities of LLMs to explain the predictions made by other predictive models. We conduct extensive analysis with these approaches on real-world tabular and text datasets and demonstrate that LLMs are capable of explaining other predictive models similar to state-of-the-art post hoc explainers, opening up promising avenues for future research into LLM-based post hoc explanations of complex predictive models.",

Summary index methods, such as the weighted quantile sum and quantile g-computation, are now commonly used to analyze environmental exposure mixtures in a broad range of applications. These methods provide a simple and interpretable framework for quantifying mixture effects. However, when data arise from a large geographical study region, it may be unreasonable to expect a common mixture effect. In this work, we explore the use of a recently developed spatially varying coefficient model based on Bayesian additive regression trees to estimate spatially heterogeneous mixture effects using quantile g-computation. We conducted simulation studies to evaluate the method's performance. We then applied this model to an analysis of multiple ambient air pollutants and birthweight in Georgia, USA from 2005-2016. We find evidence of county-level spatially varying mixture associations, where for 17 of 159 counties in Georgia, elevated concentrations of a mixture of PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide were associated with a reduction in birthweight by as much as -16.65 grams (95% credible interval: -33.93, -0.40) per decile increase in all five air pollutants.",

The dimension-wise early stopping not only reduces the risk of dimension-specific overfitting, but also reveals differences in model complexity across dimensions. The use of feature importance scores allows for simple feature selection and easy model interpretation. The model is evaluated on the same simulated and real data examples as those used in Richman and Wüthrich (Scand Actuar J 2023:71–95, 2023), and the results show that it produces results in terms of out of sample loss that are comparable to those of their neural network-based VCM called LocalGLMnet.</jats:p>",

We propose to model these latent summaries as<jats:italic>discriminative subtypes</jats:italic>: sample representations which induce accurate and interpretable sample-specific models for downstream predictions. In this way, discriminative subtypes, which are shared between data modalities, can be estimated from one data modality and optimized according to the predictions induced in another modality. We apply this approach to lung cancer by training a deep neural network to predict discriminative subtypes from histopathology images, and use these predicted subtypes to generate models which classify adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and healthy tissue based on transcriptomic signatures. In this way, we optimize the latent discriminative subtypes through induced prediction loss, and the discriminative subtypes are interpreted with standard interpretation of transcriptomic predictive models. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy (F1-score of 0.97) and identifies discriminative subtypes which link histopathology images to transcriptomic explanations without requiring pre-specification of morphological patterns or transcriptomic processes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cancers are shaped by somatic mutations, microenvironment, and patient background, each altering gene expression and regulation in complex ways, resulting in heterogeneous cellular states and dynamics. Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from expression data can help characterize this regulation-driven heterogeneity, but network inference requires many statistical samples, limiting GRNs to cluster-level analyses that ignore intra-cluster heterogeneity. We propose to move beyond coarse analyses of pre-defined subgroups by using<jats:italic>contextualized</jats:italic>learning, a multi-task learning paradigm that uses multi-view contexts including phenotypic, molecular, and environmental information to infer personalized models. With sample-specific contexts, contextualization enables sample-specific models and even generalizes at test time to predict network models for entirely unseen contexts. We unify three network model classes (Correlation, Markov, Neighborhood Selection) and estimate context-specific GRNs for 7997 tumors across 25 tumor types, using copy number and driver mutation profiles, tumor microenvironment, and patient demographics as model context. Our generative modeling approach allows us to predict GRNs for unseen tumor types based on a pan-cancer model of how somatic mutations affect gene regulation. Finally, contextualized networks enable GRN-based precision oncology by providing a structured view of expression dynamics at sample-specific resolution, explaining known biomarkers in terms of network-mediated effects and leading to novel subtypings that improve survival prognosis.

We introduce contextualized network inference, leveraging multi-view contextual metadata to capture similarities and differences among heterogeneous observations during network estimation. Sharing information across contexts enables inference at sample-specific resolution, thus quantifying variation between subjects and revealing context-specific network rewiring. Applied to tumor-specific transcriptional network inference using clinical, molecular, and multi-omic data, contextualized networks improve accuracy, generalize to unseen cancer types, and discover novel prognostic tumor subtypes. By tailoring disease models to each sample, contextualized networks promise to enable precision medicine at unprecedented resolution.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

However, these models often struggle with balancing the computational efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of the coefficients. This study develops a fast and flexible STVC model to address this challenge. To enhance flexibility and interpretability, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio‐temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. We combine a pre‐conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling, to estimate the strength of each process in each coefficient in a computationally efficient manner, while removing redundant processes as necessary. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. We then apply the proposed method to a crime analysis. The result confirms that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates. The STVC model is implemented in the R package spmoran.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes are influenced by both environmental and genetic risk factors, leading to a growing interest in identifying gene–environment (G × E) interactions. A three-step variable selection method for single-index varying-coefficients models was proposed in recent research. This method selects varying and constant-effect genetic predictors, as well as non-zero loading parameters, to identify genetic factors that interact linearly or nonlinearly with a mixture of environmental factors to influence disease risk. In this paper, we extend this approach to a binary response setting given that many complex human diseases are binary traits. We also establish the oracle property for our variable selection method, demonstrating that it performs as well as if the correct sub-model were known in advance. Additionally, we assess the performance of our method through finite-sample simulations with both continuous and discrete gene variables. Finally, we apply our approach to a type 2 diabetes dataset, identifying potential genetic factors that interact with a combination of environmental variables, both linearly and nonlinearly, to influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Numerous papers have demonstrated that by using a varying coefficients model (VCM), researchers can unveil patterns of interactions between variables that could otherwise remain hidden if using the more popular regression model with an interaction term. Hence, one would expect high acceptance of the VCM as a tool for studying statistical interactions in datasets. Yet, the current paper shows that the VCM is still struggling to migrate from journals in which methods are presented to journals in which methods are utilized. First, a search in Google Scholar with the phrase “varying coefficients” returned ~79,200 results in comparison to returning ~2,710,000 results with the phrase “interaction term”. Second, a bibliometric analysis of publications with the VCM showed that in many research domains, there were more publications with the VCM in journals on methods than publications with the VCM in journals for empirical investigations. Economics and environmental studies stood out with many more publications with the VCM in empirical journals than in journals on statistical methods. The gap between the high acclaims of the VCM in the statistical literature and its low utilization rate in practice should be of concern to the research community. The possible reasons for this gap and its potential remedies are discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Modern learning algorithms excel at producing accurate but complex models of the data. However, deploying such models in the real-world requires extra care: we must ensure their reliability, robustness, and absence of undesired biases. This motivates the development of models that are equally accurate but can be also easily inspected and assessed beyond their predictive performance. To this end, we introduce contextual explanation networks (CEN)---a class of architectures that learn to predict by generating and utilizing intermediate, simplified probabilistic models. Specifically, CENs generate parameters for intermediate graphical models which are further used for prediction and play the role of explanations. Contrary to the existing post-hoc model-explanation tools, CENs learn to predict and to explain simultaneously. Our approach offers two major advantages: (i) for each prediction valid, instance-specific explanation is generated with no computational overhead and (ii) prediction via explanation acts as a regularizer and boosts performance in data-scarce settings. We analyze the proposed framework theoretically and experimentally. Our results on image and text classification and survival analysis tasks demonstrate that CENs are not only competitive with the state-of-the-art methods but also offer additional insights behind each prediction, that can be valuable for decision support. We also show that while post-hoc methods may produce misleading explanations in certain cases, CENs are consistent and allow to detect such cases systematically.",

    "abstract": "Modern applications of machine learning (ML) deal with increasingly heterogeneous datasets comprised of data collected from overlapping latent subpopulations. As a result, traditional models trained over large datasets may fail to recognize highly predictive localized effects in favour of weakly predictive global patterns. This is a problem because localized effects are critical to developing individualized policies and treatment plans in applications ranging from precision medicine to advertising. To address this challenge, we propose to estimate sample-specific models that tailor inference and prediction at the individual level. In contrast to classical ML models that estimate a single, complex model (or only a few complex models), our approach produces a model personalized to each sample. These sample-specific models can be studied to understand subgroup dynamics that go beyond coarse-grained class labels. Crucially, our approach does not assume that relationships between samples (e.g. a similarity network) are known a priori. Instead, we use unmodeled covariates to learn a latent distance metric over the samples. We apply this approach to financial, biomedical, and electoral data as well as simulated data and show that sample-specific models provide fine-grained interpretations of complicated phenomena without sacrificing predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Context-specific Bayesian networks (i.e. directed acyclic graphs, DAGs) identify context-dependent relationships between variables, but the non-convexity induced by the acyclicity requirement makes it difficult to share information between context-specific estimators (e.g. with graph generator functions). For this reason, existing methods for inferring context-specific Bayesian networks have favored breaking datasets into subsamples, limiting statistical power and resolution, and preventing the use of multidimensional and latent contexts. To overcome this challenge, we propose NOTEARS-optimized Mixtures of Archetypal DAGs (NOTMAD). NOTMAD models context-specific Bayesian networks as the output of a function which learns to mix archetypal networks according to sample context. The archetypal networks are estimated jointly with the context-specific networks and do not require any prior knowledge. We encode the acyclicity constraint as a smooth regularization loss which is back-propagated to the mixing function; in this way, NOTMAD shares information between context-specific acyclic graphs, enabling the estimation of Bayesian network structures and parameters at even single-sample resolution. We demonstrate the utility of NOTMAD and sample-specific network inference through analysis and experiments, including patient-specific gene expression networks which correspond to morphological variation in cancer.",

We present sufficient conditions to ensure fair use in empirical risk minimization and characterize failure modes that lead to fair use violations due to standard practices in model development and deployment.

    "abstract": "Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision policies from observed actions; however, existing models force a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability, limiting data-driven interpretations of human decision-making processes. Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically under different contexts. Thus, we develop Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task learning problem, where each context poses a unique task and complex decision policies can be constructed piece-wise from many simple context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear map, and generates new policy models $\\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. We provide two flavors of the CPR framework: one focusing on exact local interpretability, and one retaining full global interpretability. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients ($+7.7\\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box methods, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis of context-specific decision models.",

    "abstract": "We examine Contextualized Machine Learning (ML), a paradigm for learning heterogeneous and context-dependent effects. Contextualized ML estimates heterogeneous functions by applying deep learning to the meta-relationship between contextual information and context-specific parametric models. This is a form of varying-coefficient modeling that unifies existing frameworks including cluster analysis and cohort modeling by introducing two reusable concepts: a context encoder which translates sample context into model parameters, and sample-specific model which operates on sample predictors. We review the process of developing contextualized models, nonparametric inference from contextualized models, and identifiability conditions of contextualized models. Finally, we present the open-source PyTorch package ContextualizedML.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection is a crucial tool in machine learning and is widely applied across various scientific disciplines. Traditional supervised methods generally identify a universal set of informative features for the entire population. However, feature relevance often varies with context, while the context itself may not directly affect the outcome variable. Here, we propose a novel architecture for contextual feature selection where the subset of selected features is conditioned on the value of context variables. Our new approach, Conditional Stochastic Gates (c-STG), models the importance of features using conditional Bernoulli variables whose parameters are predicted based on contextual variables. We introduce a hypernetwork that maps context variables to feature selection parameters to learn the context-dependent gates along with a prediction model. We further present a theoretical analysis of our model, indicating that it can improve performance and flexibility over population-level methods in complex feature selection settings. Finally, we conduct an extensive benchmark using simulated and real-world datasets across multiple domains demonstrating that c-STG can lead to improved feature selection capabilities while enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Studying migration patterns driven by extreme environmental events is crucial for building a sustainable society and stable economy. Motivated by a real dataset about human migrations, this paper develops a transformed varying coefficient model for origin and destination (OD) regression to elucidate the complex associations of migration patterns with spatio-temporal dependencies and socioeconomic factors. Existing studies often overlook the dynamic effects of these factors in OD regression. Furthermore, with the increasing ease of collecting OD data, the scale of current OD regression data is typically large, necessitating the development of methods for efficiently fitting large-scale migration data. We address the challenge by proposing a new Bayesian interpretation for the proposed OD models, leveraging sufficient statistics for efficient big data computation. Our method, inspired by migration studies, promises broad applicability across various fields, contributing to refined statistical analysis techniques. Extensive numerical studies are provided, and insights from real data analysis are shared.</jats:p>",
