    "abstract": "  In this paper we estimate the dynamic parameters of a time-varying coefficient model through radial kernel functions in the context of a longitudinal study. Our proposal is based on a linear combination of weighted kernel functions involving a bandwidth, centered around a given set of time points. In addition, we study different alternatives of estimation and inference including a Frequentist approach using weighted least squares along with bootstrap methods, and a Bayesian approach through both Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational methods. We compare the estimation strategies mention above with each other, and our radial kernel functions proposal with an expansion based on regression spline, by means of an extensive simulation study considering multiples scenarios in terms of sample size, number of repeated measurements, and subject-specific correlation. Our experiments show that the capabilities of our proposal based on radial kernel functions are indeed comparable with or even better than those obtained from regression splines. We illustrate our methodology by analyzing data from two AIDS clinical studies. ",

In this way, we optimize the latent discriminative subtypes through induced prediction loss, and the discriminative subtypes are interpreted with standard interpretation of transcriptomic predictive models. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy (F1-score of 0.97) and identifies discriminative subtypes which link histopathology images to transcriptomic explanations without requiring pre-specification of morphological patterns or transcriptomic processes.</jats:p>",

We propose to move beyond cluster-based analyses by using<jats:italic>contextualized</jats:italic>learning, a multi-task learning paradigm which allows us to infer sample-specific models using phenotypic, molecular, and environmental information pertinent to the model, encoded as the model’s “context” to be conditioned on. We unify three network model classes (Correlation, Markov, Neighborhood) and estimate context-specific GRNs for 7997 tumors across 25 tumor types, with each network contextualized by copy number and driver mutation profiles, tumor microenvironment, and patient demographics. Contextualized GRNs provide a structured view of expression dynamics at sample-specific resolution, which reveal co-expression modules in correlation networks (CNs), as well as cliques and independent regulatory elements in Markov Networks (MNs) and Neighborhood Regression Networks (NNs). Our generative modeling approach allows us to predict GRNs for unseen tumor types based on a pan-cancer model of how somatic mutations affect gene regulation. Finally, contextualized networks enable GRN-based precision oncology, explaining known biomarkers in terms of network-mediated effects, and leading to novel subtypings for thyroid, brain, and gastrointestinal tumors that improve survival prognosis.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Modern learning algorithms excel at producing accurate but complex models of the data. However, deploying such models in the real-world requires extra care: we must ensure their reliability, robustness, and absence of undesired biases. This motivates the development of models that are equally accurate but can be also easily inspected and assessed beyond their predictive performance. To this end, we introduce contextual explanation networks (CEN)---a class of architectures that learn to predict by generating and utilizing intermediate, simplified probabilistic models. Specifically, CENs generate parameters for intermediate graphical models which are further used for prediction and play the role of explanations. Contrary to the existing post-hoc model-explanation tools, CENs learn to predict and to explain simultaneously. Our approach offers two major advantages: (i) for each prediction valid, instance-specific explanation is generated with no computational overhead and (ii) prediction via explanation acts as a regularizer and boosts performance in data-scarce settings. We analyze the proposed framework theoretically and experimentally. Our results on image and text classification and survival analysis tasks demonstrate that CENs are not only competitive with the state-of-the-art methods but also offer additional insights behind each prediction, that can be valuable for decision support. We also show that while post-hoc methods may produce misleading explanations in certain cases, CENs are consistent and allow to detect such cases systematically.",

    "abstract": "Modern applications of machine learning (ML) deal with increasingly heterogeneous datasets comprised of data collected from overlapping latent subpopulations. As a result, traditional models trained over large datasets may fail to recognize highly predictive localized effects in favour of weakly predictive global patterns. This is a problem because localized effects are critical to developing individualized policies and treatment plans in applications ranging from precision medicine to advertising. To address this challenge, we propose to estimate sample-specific models that tailor inference and prediction at the individual level. In contrast to classical ML models that estimate a single, complex model (or only a few complex models), our approach produces a model personalized to each sample. These sample-specific models can be studied to understand subgroup dynamics that go beyond coarse-grained class labels. Crucially, our approach does not assume that relationships between samples (e.g. a similarity network) are known a priori. Instead, we use unmodeled covariates to learn a latent distance metric over the samples. We apply this approach to financial, biomedical, and electoral data as well as simulated data and show that sample-specific models provide fine-grained interpretations of complicated phenomena without sacrificing predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Context-specific Bayesian networks (i.e. directed acyclic graphs, DAGs) identify context-dependent relationships between variables, but the non-convexity induced by the acyclicity requirement makes it difficult to share information between context-specific estimators (e.g. with graph generator functions). For this reason, existing methods for inferring context-specific Bayesian networks have favored breaking datasets into subsamples, limiting statistical power and resolution, and preventing the use of multidimensional and latent contexts. To overcome this challenge, we propose NOTEARS-optimized Mixtures of Archetypal DAGs (NOTMAD). NOTMAD models context-specific Bayesian networks as the output of a function which learns to mix archetypal networks according to sample context. The archetypal networks are estimated jointly with the context-specific networks and do not require any prior knowledge. We encode the acyclicity constraint as a smooth regularization loss which is back-propagated to the mixing function; in this way, NOTMAD shares information between context-specific acyclic graphs, enabling the estimation of Bayesian network structures and parameters at even single-sample resolution. We demonstrate the utility of NOTMAD and sample-specific network inference through analysis and experiments, including patient-specific gene expression networks which correspond to morphological variation in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are often personalized with categorical attributes that are protected, sensitive, self-reported, or costly to acquire. In this work, we show models that are personalized with group attributes can reduce performance at a group level. We propose formal conditions to ensure the \"fair use\" of group attributes in prediction tasks by training one additional model -- i.e., collective preference guarantees to ensure that each group who provides personal data will receive a tailored gain in performance in return. We present sufficient conditions to ensure fair use in empirical risk minimization and characterize failure modes that lead to fair use violations due to standard practices in model development and deployment. We present a comprehensive empirical study of fair use in clinical prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate the prevalence of fair use violations in practice and illustrate simple interventions to mitigate their harm.",

    "abstract": "Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision policies from observed actions; however, existing models force a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability, limiting data-driven interpretations of human decision-making processes. Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically under different contexts. Thus, we develop Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task learning problem, where each context poses a unique task and complex decision policies can be constructed piece-wise from many simple context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear map, and generates new policy models $\\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. We provide two flavors of the CPR framework: one focusing on exact local interpretability, and one retaining full global interpretability. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients ($+7.7\\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box methods, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis of context-specific decision models.",

    "abstract": "We examine Contextualized Machine Learning (ML), a paradigm for learning heterogeneous and context-dependent effects. Contextualized ML estimates heterogeneous functions by applying deep learning to the meta-relationship between contextual information and context-specific parametric models. This is a form of varying-coefficient modeling that unifies existing frameworks including cluster analysis and cohort modeling by introducing two reusable concepts: a context encoder which translates sample context into model parameters, and sample-specific model which operates on sample predictors. We review the process of developing contextualized models, nonparametric inference from contextualized models, and identifiability conditions of contextualized models.

    "abstract": "Feature selection is a crucial tool in machine learning and is widely applied across various scientific disciplines. Traditional supervised methods generally identify a universal set of informative features for the entire population. However, feature relevance often varies with context, while the context itself may not directly affect the outcome variable. Here, we propose a novel architecture for contextual feature selection where the subset of selected features is conditioned on the value of context variables. Our new approach, Conditional Stochastic Gates (c-STG), models the importance of features using conditional Bernoulli variables whose parameters are predicted based on contextual variables. We introduce a hypernetwork that maps context variables to feature selection parameters to learn the context-dependent gates along with a prediction model. We further present a theoretical analysis of our model, indicating that it can improve performance and flexibility over population-level methods in complex feature selection settings. Finally, we conduct an extensive benchmark using simulated and real-world datasets across multiple domains demonstrating that c-STG can lead to improved feature selection capabilities while enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability.",
