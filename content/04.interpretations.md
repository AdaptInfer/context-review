## Context-Adaptive Interpretations of Context-Invariant Models

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of context in model parameters. 
Such context-adaptive models can be learned by explicitly modeling the impact of contextual variables on model parameters, or learned implicitly in a model containing interaction effects between the context and the input features.
In this section, we will focus on recent progress in understanding how context influences interpretations of statistical models, even when the model was not originally designed to incorporate context.

TODO: Discussing the implications of context-adaptive interpretations for traditional models. Related work including LIME/DeepLift/DeepSHAP.
