## Historical Foundations of Context-Adaptive Inference

(TODO)
<br>
<br>

### Statistical Origins
- Hierarchical models, random effects, interaction terms (1940s–60s).
- Varying-coefficient models, splines, functional data analysis (1970s–90s).
- Mixed models
- Functional data analysis, etc.

<br>
<br>


### Emergence in Machine Learning
- Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997).
- Transfer learning surveys (Pan & Yang, 2010).
- Contextual bandits and covariate shift, etc.

<br>
<br>


### Meta-Learning and Representation Learning
- Amortized inference, VAEs.
- MAML and gradient-based meta-learning (2010s), etc.

<br>
<br>


### Foundation Models and Implicit Adaptivity
- GPT-3 and few-shot ICL.
- Induction heads and mechanistic work.
- Links to invariance and OOD generalization.
