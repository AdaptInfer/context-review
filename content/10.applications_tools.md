### Context-Aware Efficiency in Practice

The principles of context-aware efficiency find practical applications across diverse domains, demonstrating how computational and statistical efficiency can be achieved through intelligent context utilization.

In healthcare applications, context-aware efficiency enables adaptive imaging protocols that adjust scan parameters based on patient context such as age, symptoms, and medical history, reducing unnecessary radiation exposure. Personalized screening schedules optimize screening frequency based on individual risk factors and previous results, while resource allocation systems efficiently distribute limited healthcare resources based on patient acuity and context.

Financial services leverage context-aware efficiency principles in risk assessment by adapting risk models based on market conditions, economic indicators, and individual borrower characteristics. Fraud detection systems use context-dependent thresholds and sampling strategies to balance detection accuracy with computational cost, while portfolio optimization dynamically adjusts rebalancing frequency based on market volatility and transaction costs [@ang2014asset].

Industrial applications benefit from context-aware efficiency through predictive maintenance systems that adapt maintenance schedules based on equipment context including age, usage patterns, and environmental conditions [@lei2018machinery]. Quality control implements context-dependent sampling strategies that focus computational resources on high-risk production batches, and inventory management uses context-aware forecasting to optimize stock levels across different product categories and market conditions.

A notable example of context-aware efficiency is adaptive clinical trial design, where trial parameters are dynamically adjusted based on accumulating evidence while maintaining statistical validity. Population enrichment refines patient selection criteria based on early trial results, and dose finding optimizes treatment dosages based on individual patient responses and safety profiles. These applications demonstrate how context-aware efficiency principles can lead to substantial improvements in both computational performance and real-world outcomes.


### Contextualized Network Inference

One domain where context-adaptive models have shown particular promise is in network inference for genomics. Traditional approaches assume that all samples can be pooled into a single network, or that cohorts can be partitioned into homogeneous groups. These assumptions are often unrealistic: cancer, for example, exhibits both cross-patient heterogeneity and within-patient shifts in gene regulation. 

Contextualized network models address this challenge by learning archetypal networks and then representing each sample as a mixture of these archetypes, weighted by its observed context. This formulation allows researchers to move beyond average-case networks and uncover mechanisms of disease, heterogeneity across patients, driver mutations, and structural hazards.
