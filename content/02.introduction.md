## Introduction

A convenient simplifying assumption in statistical modeling is that observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). 
This assumption allows us to use a single model to make predictions across all data points. 
But in practice, this assumption rarely holds. 
Data are collected across different individuals, environments, and tasks -- each with their own characteristics, constraints, and dynamics.
When the i.i.d. assumption breaks down, using a single global model can obscure meaningful heterogeneity.

To model this heterogeneity, a growing class of methods aim to make inference *adaptive to context*. These include varying-coefficient models in statistics, transfer and meta-learning in machine learning, and in-context learning in large foundation models. Though these approaches arise from different traditions, they share a common goal: to use contextual information -- whether covariates, environments, or support sets -- to inform sample-specific inference.

We formalize this by assuming each observation $x_i$ is drawn from a distribution governed by parameters $\theta_i$:

$$
x_i \sim P(x; \theta_i).
$$

In population models, the assumption is that $\theta_i = \theta$ for all $i$. In context-adaptive models, we instead posit that the parameters vary with context:

$$
\theta_i = f(c_i) \quad \text{or} \quad \theta_i \sim P(\theta \mid c_i),
$$

where $c_i$ captures the relevant covariates or environment for observation $i$. The goal is to estimate either a deterministic function $f$ or a conditional distribution over parameters.

This shift raises new modeling challenges. 
Estimating a unique $\theta_i$ from a single observation is ill-posed without structural regularization—smoothness, sparsity, shared representations, or latent grouping. 
And as adaptivity becomes more implicit (e.g., via neural networks or black-box inference), we must develop tools to recover, interpret, or constrain the underlying parameter variation.

### Theoretical Bridges and Scope

Recent theoretical work has revealed that the boundary between explicit and implicit approaches to context adaptation may be narrower than it first appears. 
A growing line of research has shown that transformers trained on regression tasks can implement classical estimators such as ordinary least squares, ridge regression, and even nonlinear kernel regression in context [@arXiv:2212.07677; @arXiv:2208.01066; @arXiv:2212.10559]. 
In other words, while varying-coefficient models specify a mapping from context to parameters explicitly, in-context learning can implicitly perform the same estimators through internal computation. 
This emerging bridge motivates a unified treatment of explicit statistical models and implicit foundation models within a single conceptual framework.

In this review, we examine methods that use context to guide inference, either by specifying how parameters change with covariates or by learning to adapt behavior implicitly. 
We begin with classical models that impose explicit structure, such as varying-coefficient models and multi-task learning, and then turn to more flexible approaches like meta-learning and in-context learning with foundation models. 
Though these methods arise from different traditions, they share a common goal: to tailor inference to the local characteristics of each observation or task. 
Along the way, we highlight recurring themes: complex models often decompose into simpler, context-specific components; foundation models can both adapt to and generate context; and context-awareness challenges classical assumptions of homogeneity. 
These perspectives offer a unifying lens on recent advances and open new directions for building adaptive, interpretable, and personalized models.

### Related Surveys and Reviews

Several surveys have examined specific aspects of context-adaptive inference, but they have largely remained confined to individual methodological traditions. 
Classical statistical surveys focus on varying-coefficient models and related structured regression methods. 
In machine learning, surveys on transfer and meta-learning emphasize task adaptation and shared representations, while recent work on foundation models explores the implicit adaptation capabilities of large pretrained models. 
Table 1 summarizes the scope and coverage of representative surveys.

While existing surveys have reviewed individual components of this landscape—such as varying-coefficient models, meta-learning, or foundation models—they have remained largely siloed.
This article provides the first comprehensive review that unifies explicit and implicit context-adaptive methods under a common framework.
By situating classical statistical models, modern machine learning methods, and foundation models along a shared spectrum of context-adaptive inference, we highlight common principles and distinctive challenges.
The next section outlines the conceptual foundations of context-adaptive inference, preparing the ground for detailed discussions of explicit and implicit modeling approaches in later sections.
