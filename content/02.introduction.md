## Introduction

A convenient simplifying assumption in statistical modeling is that observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). 
This assumption allows us to use a single model to make predictions across all data points. 
But in practice, this assumption rarely holds. 
Data are collected across different individuals, environments, and tasks -- each with their own characteristics, constraints, and dynamics.

To model this heterogeneity, a growing class of methods aim to make inference *adaptive to context*. These include varying-coefficient models in statistics, transfer and meta-learning in machine learning, and in-context learning in large foundation models. Though these approaches arise from different traditions, they share a common goal: to use contextual information -- whether covariates, environments, or support sets -- to inform sample-specific inference.

We formalize this by assuming each observation $x_i$ is drawn from a distribution governed by parameters $\theta_i$:

$$
x_i \sim P(x; \theta_i).
$$

In population models, the assumption is that $\theta_i = \theta$ for all $i$. In context-adaptive models, we instead posit that the parameters vary with context:

$$
\theta_i = f(c_i) \quad \text{or} \quad \theta_i \sim P(\theta \mid c_i),
$$

where $c_i$ captures the relevant covariates or environment for observation $i$. The goal is to estimate either a deterministic function $f$ or a conditional distribution over parameters.

This shift raises new modeling challenges. 
Estimating a unique $\theta_i$ from a single observation is ill-posed unless we impose structure—smoothness, sparsity, shared representations, or latent grouping. 
And as adaptivity becomes more implicit (e.g., via neural networks or black-box inference), we must develop tools to recover, interpret, or constrain the underlying parameter variation.


In this review, we examine methods that use context to guide inference, either by specifying how parameters change with covariates or by learning to adapt behavior implicitly. 
We begin with classical models that impose explicit structure—such as varying-coefficient models and multi-task learning—and then turn to more flexible approaches like meta-learning and in-context learning with foundation models. 
Though these methods arise from different traditions, they share a common goal: to tailor inference to the local characteristics of each observation or task. 
Along the way, we highlight recurring themes: complex models often decompose into simpler, context-specific components; foundation models can both adapt to and generate context; and context-awareness challenges classical assumptions of homogeneity. 
These perspectives offer a unifying lens on recent advances and open new directions for building adaptive, interpretable, and personalized models.
