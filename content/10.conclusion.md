### Context-Aware Efficiency: A Unifying Framework

The principles of context-aware efficiency emerge as a unifying theme across the diverse methods surveyed in this review. This framework provides a systematic approach to designing methods that are both computationally tractable and statistically principled.

Several fundamental insights emerge from our analysis. Rather than being a nuisance parameter, context provides information that can be leveraged to improve both statistical and computational efficiency. Methods that adapt their computational strategy based on context often achieve better performance than those that use fixed approaches. The design of context-aware methods requires careful consideration of how to balance computational efficiency with interpretability and regulatory compliance.

Future research in context-aware efficiency should focus on developing methods that can efficiently handle high-dimensional, multimodal context information, creating systems that can adaptively allocate computational resources based on context complexity and urgency, investigating how efficiency principles learned in one domain can be transferred to others, and ensuring that context-aware efficiency methods can be deployed in regulated environments while maintaining interpretability.

The development of context-aware efficiency principles has implications beyond statistical modeling. More efficient methods reduce computational costs and environmental impact, enabling sustainable computing practices. Efficient methods also democratize AI by enabling deployment of sophisticated models on resource-constrained devices. Furthermore, context-aware efficiency enables deployment of personalized models in time-critical applications, supporting real-time decision making.

### Formal optimization view of context-aware efficiency

Let \(f_\phi\!:\!\mathcal{X}\!\times\!\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{Y}\) be a context-conditioned predictor with shared parameters \(\phi\). Given per-context compute budgets \(T(c)\) and a global regularizer \(\Omega(\phi)\), a resource-aware training objective is
\[
\min_{\phi}\; \mathbb{E}_{(x,y,c)\sim \mathcal{D}}\, \ell\big(f_\phi(x,c),y\big) \, + \, \lambda\,\Omega(\phi) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad \mathbb{E}_{c}\, \mathcal{C}\big(f_\phi; T(c), c\big) \le B,
\]
where \(\mathcal{C}(\cdot)\) models compute/latency. The Lagrangian relaxation
\[
\min_{\phi}\; \mathbb{E}_{(x,y,c)}\, \ell\big(f_\phi(x,c),y\big) + \lambda\,\Omega(\phi) + \gamma\, \mathbb{E}_{c}\, \mathcal{C}\big(f_\phi; T(c), c\big)
\]
trades off accuracy and compute via \(\gamma\). For mixture-of-experts or sparsity-inducing designs, let \(\phi=(\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_M)\) and a gating \(\pi_\phi(m\mid c)\). A compute-aware sparsity penalty is
\[
\Omega(\phi) \,=\, \sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m\,\|\phi_m\|_2^2 \, + \, \tau\, \mathbb{E}_{c}\, \sum_{m=1}^M \pi_\phi(m\mid c),
\]
encouraging few active modules per context. Under smoothness and strong convexity, the optimality conditions yield KKT stationarity
\[
\nabla_\phi \Big( \mathbb{E}\,\ell + \lambda\,\Omega + \gamma\,\mathbb{E}_c\,\mathcal{C} \Big) \,=\, 0, \quad \gamma\,\Big( \mathbb{E}_c\,\mathcal{C} - B \Big)=0, \quad \gamma\ge 0.
\]
This perspective clarifies that context-aware efficiency arises from jointly selecting representation sharing, per-context compute allocation \(T(c)\), and sparsity in active submodules subject to resource budgets.
