### Advances in Varying-Coefficient Models
TODO: Outlining key theoretical and methodological breakthroughs.

### Integration with State-of-the-Art Machine Learning
TODO: Assessing the enhancement of VC models through modern ML technologies (e.g. deep learning, boosted trees, etc).

### Context-Invariant Training
TODO: The converse of VC models, exploring the implications of training context-invariant models.
e.g. out-of-distribution generalization, robustness to adversarial attacks.
