## From Population Assumptions to Context-Adaptive Inference


Most statistical and machine learning models begin with a foundational assumption: that all samples are drawn independently and identically from a shared population distribution. This assumption simplifies estimation and enables generalization from limited data, but it collapses in the presence of meaningful heterogeneity.

In practice, data often reflect differences across individuals, environments, or conditions. These differences may stem from biological variation, temporal drift, site effects, or shifts in measurement context. Treating heterogeneous data as if it were homogeneous can obscure real effects, inflate variance, and lead to brittle predictions.

### Failure Modes of Population Models

Even when traditional models appear to fit aggregate data well, they may hide systematic failure modes.

**Mode Collapse**  
When one subpopulation is much larger than another, standard models are biased toward the dominant group, underrepresenting the minority group in both fit and predictions.

**Outlier Sensitivity**  
In the parameter-averaging regime, small but extreme groups can disproportionately distort the global model, especially in methods like ordinary least squares.

**Phantom Populations**  
When multiple subpopulations are equally represented, the global model may fit none of them well, instead converging to a solution that represents a non-existent average case.

These behaviors reflect a deeper problem: the assumption of identically distributed samples is not just incorrect, but actively harmful in heterogeneous settings.


### Toward Context-Aware Models

To account for heterogeneity, we must relax the assumption of shared parameters and allow the data-generating process to vary across samples. A general formulation assumes each observation is governed by its own latent parameters:
$$
x_i \sim P(x; \theta_i),
$$

However, estimating $N$ free parameters from $N$ samples is underdetermined. 
Context-aware approaches resolve this by introducing structure on how parameters vary, often by assuming that $\theta_i$ depends on an observed context $c_i$:

$$
\theta_i = f(c_i) \quad \text{or} \quad \theta_i \sim P(\theta \mid c_i).
$$

This formulation makes the model estimable, but it raises new challenges. 
How should $f$ be chosen? How smooth, flexible, or structured should it be? The remainder of this review explores different answers to this question, and shows how implicit and explicit representations of context can lead to powerful, personalized models.

### Early Remedies: Grouped and Distance-Based Models

Before diving into flexible estimators of $f(c)$, we review early modeling strategies that attempt to break away from homogeneity.

#### Conditional and Clustered Models

One approach is to group observations into C contexts, either by manually defining conditions (e.g. male vs. female) or using unsupervised clustering. Each group is then assigned a distinct parameter vector:

$$
\{\widehat{\theta}_0, \ldots, \widehat{\theta}_C\} = \arg\max_{\theta_0, \ldots, \theta_C} \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \ell(X_c; \theta_c),
$$
where $\ell(X; \theta)$ is the log-likelihood of $\theta$ on $X$ and $c$ specifies the covariate group that samples are assigned to. This reduces variance but limits granularity. It assumes that all members of a group share the same distribution and fails to capture variation within a group.

#### Distance-Regularized Estimation

A more flexible alternative assumes that observations with similar contexts should have similar parameters. This is encoded as a regularization penalty that discourages large differences in $\theta_i$ for nearby $c_i$:

$$
\{\widehat{\theta}_0, \ldots, \widehat{\theta}_N\} = \arg\max_{\theta_0, \ldots, \theta_N} \left( \sum_i \ell(x_i; \theta_i) - \sum_{i,j} \frac{\|\theta_i - \theta_j\|}{D(c_i, c_j)} \right),
$$

where $D(c_i, c_j)$ is a distance metric between contexts. This approach allows for smoother parameter variation but requires careful choice of $D$ and regularization strength $\lambda$ to balance bias and variance.  
The choice of distance metric D and regularization strength λ controls the bias–variance tradeoff.

#### Parametric Varying-coefficient models
Original paper (based on a smoothing spline function): @doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1993.tb01939.x
Markov networks: @doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.2000866
Linear varying-coefficient models assume that parameters vary linearly with covariates, a much stronger assumption than the classic varying-coefficient model but making a conceptual leap that allows us to define a form for the relationship between the parameters and covariates. 
$$\widehat{\theta}_0, ..., \widehat{\theta}_N = \widehat{A} C^T$$
$$ \widehat{A} = \arg\max_A \sum_i \ell(x_i; A c_i) $$

TODO: Note that they achieve distance-matching by using a distance metric under Euclidean distance, which is a special case of the distance-regularized estimation above.

##### Semi-parametric varying-coefficient Models
Original paper: @doi:10.1214/aos/1017939139
2-step estimation with RBF kernels: @arxiv:2103.00315

Classic varying-coefficient models assume that models with similar covariates have similar parameters, or -- more formally -- that changes in parameters are smooth over the covariate space.
This assumption is encoded as a sample weighting, often using a kernel, where the relevance of a sample to a model is equivalent to its kernel similarity over the covariate space.
$$\widehat{\theta}_0, ..., \widehat{\theta}_N = \arg\max_{\theta_0, ..., \theta_N} \sum_{i, j} \frac{K(c_i, c_j)}{\sum_{k} K(c_i, c_k)} \ell(x_j; \theta_i)$$
This estimator is the simplest to recover $N$ unique parameter estimates. 
However, the assumption here is contradictory to the partition model estimator. 
When the relationship between covariates and parameters is discontinuous or abrupt, this estimator will fail.

##### Contextualized Models
Seminal work @doi:10.48550/arXiv.1705.10301
Contextualized ML generalization and applications: @doi:10.48550/arXiv.2310.11340, @doi:10.48550/arXiv.2111.01104, @doi:10.21105/joss.06469, @doi:10.48550/arXiv.2310.07918, @doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104086, @doi:10.1101/2020.06.25.20140053, @doi:10.1101/2023.12.01.569658, @doi:10.48550/arXiv.2312.14254

Contextualized models make the assumption that parameters are some function of context, but make no assumption on the form of that function. 
In this regime, we seek to estimate the function often using a deep learner (if we have some differentiable proxy for probability):
$$ \widehat{f} = \arg \max_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \sum_i \ell(x_i; f(c_i)) $$

### Latent-structure Models

##### Partition Models
Markov networks: @doi:10.1214/09-AOAS308
Partition models also assume that parameters can be partitioned into homogeneous groups over the covariate space, but make no assumption about where these partitions occur.
This allows the use of information from different groups in estimating a model for a each covariate. 
Partition model estimators are most often utilized to infer abrupt model changes over time and take the form
$$ \widehat{\theta}_0, ..., \widehat{\theta}_N = \arg\max_{\theta_0, ..., \theta_N} \sum_i \ell(x_i; \theta_i) + \sum_{i = 2}^N \text{TV}(\theta_i, \theta_{i-1})$$
Where the regularizaiton term might take the form 
$$\text{TV}(\theta_i, \theta_{i - 1}) = |\theta_i - \theta_{i-1}|$$ 
This still fails to recover a unique parameter estimate for each sample, but gets closer to the spirit of personalized modeling by putting the model likelihood and partition regularizer in competition to find the optimal partitions. 


### Fine-tuned Models and Transfer Learning
Review: @doi:10.48550/arXiv.2206.02058
Noted in foundational literature for linear varying coefficient models @doi:10.1214/aos/1017939139

Estimate a population model, freeze these parameters, and then include a smaller set of personalized parameters to estimate on a smaller subpopulation.
$$ \widehat{\gamma} = \arg\max_{\gamma} = \ell(\gamma; X) $$
$$ \widehat{\theta_c} = \arg\max_{\theta_c} = \ell(\theta_c; \widehat{\gamma}, X_c) $$



### Context-informed and Latent-structure models
Seminal paper: @doi:10.48550/arXiv.1910.06939

Key idea: negative information sharing. Different models should be pushed apart.
$$ \widehat{\theta}_0, ..., \widehat{\theta}_N = \arg\max_{\theta_0, ..., \theta_N, D} \sum_{i=0}^N \prod_{j=0 s.t. D(c_i, c_j) < d}^N P(x_j; \theta_i) P(\theta_i ; \theta_j) $$


### A Spectrum of Context-Awareness

Context-aware models can be viewed along a spectrum of assumptions about the relationship between context and parameters.

**Global models**: $\theta_i = \theta$ for all $i$  
**Grouped models**: $\theta_i = \theta_c$ for some finite set of groups  
**Smooth models**: $\theta_i = f(c_i)$, with $f$ assumed to be continuous or low-complexity  
**Latent models**: $\theta_i \sim P(\theta | c_i)$, with $f$ learned implicitly

Each of these choices encodes different beliefs about how parameters vary. The next section formalizes this variation and examines general principles for adaptivity in statistical modeling.
