## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Context-adaptive inference enhances statistical methods by allowing model parameters to shift with context, either explicitly through parameter learning or implicitly via interactions between context and input features. 
In this review, we outline recent progress in integrating context into statistical models and explore the potential of foundation models to serve as context providers. 
We conclude by discussing future trends, challenges, and opportunities in context-adaptive statistical inference.
